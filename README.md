# Smart Construction Site Coordination System (SCSCS)

## Project Overview
The Smart Construction Site Coordination System (SCSCS) is a project management–oriented software prototype designed to improve coordination, scheduling, risk management, and progress reporting on construction sites. The system provides a centralized environment where project stakeholders can effectively collaborate throughout the construction process.

## Problem Statement
Construction projects often experience delays, cost overruns, and coordination problems due to fragmented communication, unclear task responsibilities, and late identification of risks. Tasks are frequently tracked using disconnected tools or manual methods, making it difficult to monitor progress in real time and respond proactively to issues.

## Proposed Solution
SCSCS addresses these challenges by offering a centralized platform that organizes construction activities into structured tasks and work packages. The system enables clear task assignment, real-time progress tracking, risk reporting and mitigation, and weekly progress reporting to support informed decision-making and effective project management.

## Project Objectives
- Improve coordination between construction project stakeholders  
- Enhance task visibility and responsibility tracking  
- Identify and manage risks at an early stage  
- Support schedule management and progress monitoring  
- Apply project management principles in a realistic construction use case  

## Project Management Tools
- **Jira Software** – Task and workflow management (Kanban board)  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project repository  
- **PlantUML** – UML diagram generation  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Project planning, budgeting, and risk management

## Jira Task Management
All project tasks were managed using Jira Software. Tasks were tracked through different workflow stages (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done) to demonstrate task planning and progress monitoring.

## Notes
This repository contains project planning artifacts and documentation prepared for the Project Management course. The focus of the project is on planning, coordination, and management processes rather than full software implementation.
